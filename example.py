# decided to add another score to that last bookpart, but with a nasty detail.
# It will be exactly the same Choir than before, but without the Soprano.

# 'add' is used because '+' creates a copy of the context.
# We could use :
# t.book -= part
# part += choir1 - choir1.soprano
# t.book += part
# But it's dirty and uses more code, memory, and execution time.


# And at last but not least, we generate our output 'example.ly' and compile it
# to get a beautiful score !
